nfdhcpd
=======

**WARNING:** This repository has been deprecated in favor of
[nfdhcpd](https://github.com/grnet/nfdhcpd/).

Overview
--------

This is nfdhpcd, a userspace server written in python and based on
[NFQUEUE](https://www.wzdftpd.net/redmine/projects/nfqueue-bindings/wiki/). The
administrator can enable processing of DHCP, NS, RS, DHCPv6 requests on
individual TAP interfaces by injecting nfdhcpd in the processing pipeline for
IP packets dynamically (by mangling the corresponding packet types and redirect
them to the appropriate nfqueue).

The daemon runs on the host and is controlled by manipulating files
under its state directory. Creation of a new file under this directory
("binding file") instructs the daemon to reply on the requests arriving
on the specified TAP interface.

nfdhpcd is meant to work with [Ganeti](http://code.google.com/p/ganeti) and
[snf-network](https://github.com/grnet/snf-network). Instances inside the
cluster will obtain their configuration dynamically in a completely transparent
way without being aware of nfdhpcd's existence.
